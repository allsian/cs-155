% LaTeX is simple if you have a good template to work with! To use this document, simply fill in your text where we have indicated. To write mathematical notation in a fancy style, just write the notation inside enclosing $dollar signs$.

% For example:
% $y = x^2 + 2x + 1$

\section{Introduction}
\medskip
\begin{itemize}

    \item \boldline{Group members} \\
    Bolton Bailey, David Inglis

    \item \boldline{Team name} \\
    OneHotTeam

    \item \boldline{Division of labour} \\
    We both pair coded all the implementation, and discussed our approach together.

\end{itemize}



\section{Tokenizing}
\medskip
\begin{itemize}


    \item \boldline{What methods did you use and try to tokenize the sonnets?}
    \begin{itemize}
    % Insert text here. Bullet points can be made using '\item'. Models and techniques should be bolded using '\textbf{}'.
    \item \textbf{Bullet:} Bullet text.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \boldline{Did you have to make changes to the way you tokenized after running the algorithm and seeing the results?}
    \begin{itemize}
    % Insert text here. Bullet points can be made using '\item'.
    \item \textbf{Bullet:} Bullet text.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}



\section{Algorithm}
\medskip
\begin{itemize}

    What packages did you use for the algorithm?
    What decisions did you have to make when running the algorithm and what did you try? e.g number of states
    How did this affect the sonnets that were generated

    \item \boldline{Data processing and manipulation}
    \begin{itemize}
    % Insert text here. Bullet points can be made using '\item'.
    \item \textbf{Bullet:} Bullet text.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \boldline{Details of models and techniques}
    \begin{itemize}
    % Insert text here. Bullet points can be made using '\item'.
    \item \textbf{Bullet:} Bullet text.

    % If you would like to insert a figure, you can just use the following five lines, replacing the image path with your own and the caption with a 1-2 sentence description of what the image is and how it is relevant or useful.
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{smiley.png}
    \caption{Insert caption here.}
    \end{figure}

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}



\section{Poetry Generation}
\medskip
\begin{itemize}

    How did you generate your poem?
How did you get your poem to look as much like a sonnet as possible?
What makes sense/what doesn't about the sonnets generated?

    \item \boldline{Scoring} \\
    % Insert text here.

    \item \boldline{Validation and Test} \\
    % Insert text here.

\end{itemize}



\section{Visualization and Interpretation}
\medskip
\begin{itemize}
    For at least 5 hidden states give a list of the top 10 words that associate with this hidden state and
state any common features these groups.
What are some properties of the different hidden states?
e.g. Correlation between hidden states and syllable counts, connotations of words, etc.
Make a visual representation of the correlation between states and words

    \item \boldline{Challenges} \\
    % Insert text here.

    \item \boldline{Concluding Remarks} \\
    % Insert text here.

\end{itemize}


\section{Additional Goals}
\medskip
\begin{itemize}
    e.g. rhyme/meter

    \item \boldline{Discoveries} \\
    % Insert text here.

    \item \boldline{Challenges} \\
    % Insert text here.

    \item \boldline{Concluding Remarks} \\
    % Insert text here.

\end{itemize}



\section{Conclusion}
\medskip
\begin{itemize}
    How was the work divided up?
What are your conclusions/observations about the models you used and the sonnets generated?

    \item \boldline{Discoveries} \\
    % Insert text here.

    \item \boldline{Challenges} \\
